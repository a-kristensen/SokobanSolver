# SokobanSolver
This is a solver for the Sokoban game.
I made it, when I was in university, as part of a project in the class, Introduction to artificial intelligence.

In the solver the 3 methods are implemented: breadth-first, depth-first and A*.
The solve-time improves drasticly, if executed at Linux, as opposed to Windows.
